### Background

investors want to ensure that there are enough customers between the seasons to sustain a small business throughout the year. I was asked to gather data on the seasons to determine if there are certain times of the year when business might be slower, or if the type of customer changes.

### Objectives

1. Determine key statistical data about the month of June.
2. Determine key statistical data about the month of December.
3. Compare findings between the month of June and December.
4. Make 2 or 3 recommendations for further analysis.
