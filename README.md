### Background

investors want to ensure that there are enough customers between the seasons to sustain a small business in Ohau, Hawaii throughout the year. I was asked to gather data on the seasons to determine if there are certain times of the year when business might be slower, or if the type of customer changes.

### Objectives

1. Determine key statistical data about the month of June.
2. Determine key statistical data about the month of December.
3. Compare findings between the month of June and December.
4. Make 2 or 3 recommendations for further analysis.

### Summary 

I found that the average temperature during the month of June is about 75 degrees. For the month of December the average temperature was 71 degrees. The difference in temperature is 4 degrees on average. The lowest temperature recorded in June was 64 degrees and the highest was 85 degrees. In December the lowest recorded temperature was 56 degrees and the highest was 83 degrees.
