### Background

investors want to ensure that there are enough customers between the seasons to sustain a small business in Ohau, Hawaii throughout the year. I was asked to gather data on the seasons to determine if there are certain times of the year when business might be slower, or if the type of customer changes.

### Objectives

1. Determine key statistical data about the month of June.
2. Determine key statistical data about the month of December.
3. Compare findings between the month of June and December.
4. Make 2 or 3 recommendations for further analysis.

### Summary 

I found that the average temperature during the month of June is about 75 degrees. For the month of December the average temperature was 71 degrees. The difference in temperature is 4 degrees on average. The lowest temperature recorded in June was 64 degrees and the highest was 85 degrees. In December the lowest recorded temperature was 56 degrees and the highest was 83 degrees. 

### Recommendations

1. Differences in precipitation during both months would have been a good metric to compare. Customers may be less inclined to leave their homes when it is raining. 

2. The investors should not use temperature as the only metric to determine the sustainablitiy of a Hawaiian business. the temperature range is from a minimum of 56 degrees in December to a maximum temperature of 85 degrees in June with a average temperature in the low to mid 70's. Because the temperature is near perfect all of the time, I'm not confident that these small fluctuations in temperatures will stop customers from surfing and eating ice cream. 

3. I recommend that we further dig into the temperature and precipitation data. Instead of organizing the data by month alone, we should seperate it by week or even day. Certain times of the month may be consistent with exceptionally high/low temperature and precipitation. Flagging these days might be of greater help to the investors with forcasting.
